# ios-multi-back-button

Replacement for the built-in UInavigationController back-button that allows going back multiple
levels. 

Users long-tap the back-button to display a table with the viewControllers in the current navigation
stack. They either lift the finger and tap a table-cell or move it above the table and release above 
the cell for the view-controller you want to navigate to. If they do a regular tap, the back-button 
will bring you back a single level as usual.

You configure a view-controller to use there buttons with somelink like

````
#import "MultiBackButtonItem.h"
 â‹®
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [self configureMultiBackButton];
    self.multiBackButtonImage = [UIImage imageNamed: @"myImage"];
}
````

You need to include `MultiBackButtonItem.h`, `MultiBackButtonItem.m` and the `back` image found in the `Images.xcassets` in your project.

Because I have not reliable way to determine how much space is available in the navigation bar, the
back-button never shows the title of the previous view controller. I would much rather it included a title 
if there was sufficient space for this and you can find some traces of attempts at this. Suggestions on
how to do it are very welcome.
